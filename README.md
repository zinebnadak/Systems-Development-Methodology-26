# Software Engineering — Requirements, Architecture & Process

This repository documents my practical work in **software engineering**, with a focus on
requirements, system design, development processes, and validation.

The emphasis is on building systems that are **understandable, testable, and maintainable** —
not just writing code.

---

## Goals

- Analyze and evaluate different **software development processes**
- Identify, document, and manage **system requirements**
- Use **diagrams and prototypes** to analyze and communicate requirements
- Design and reason about **common system architectures**
- Apply techniques for **verification and validation**
- Understand and apply **open-source principles**
- Use professional **development tools** (version control, modeling, testing)
- Apply **agile methods** for requirements analysis and prototyping

---

## Scope

- Software development processes
- Requirements specification and analysis
- System and architecture models
- UML and graphical modeling
- Prototyping
- Open-source methodology
- Verification, validation, and testing
- Version control
- Agile, project-based development

---

## Approach

Work in this repository is treated as part of a **real software project**:
- requirements must be traceable
- designs must be justifiable
- prototypes must serve a purpose
- validation must be explicit

If a model, requirement, or process wouldn’t make sense in a real project, it doesn’t belong here.
