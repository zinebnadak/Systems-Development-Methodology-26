Use Cases

Q1: Why can text-based requirements and designs be problematic?
A1: They can be exact and complete but often become complex and hard to understand.

Q2: How do diagrams help in requirements and system design?
A2: Use symbols and abstraction to show requirements, functionality, and relationships clearly.

Q3: What is Astah and why is it used?
A3: A UML tool for diagramming requirements and design; supports various diagram types and acts as a “table of contents” for specifications.

Q4: What is UML?
A4: Unified Modeling Language; a standardized way to visualize system structure and behavior.

Q5: What is a use case diagram?
A5: Shows operations a user (actor) can perform; actors can be primary, secondary, humans, or systems.

Q6: What are primary vs secondary users?
A6: Primary: main user performing the use case.
Secondary: other users helping complete the use case.

Q7: How do actors and roles work?
A7: One physical user can take on multiple roles; different actors represent different perspectives in the system.

Q8: What are the key relationships between use cases?
A8:
- Include: B always occurs when A occurs (reusable functionality).
- Extend: A sometimes adds functionality to B (alternative flows, exceptions).

Q9: Practical tip for use case diagrams:
A9: “If in doubt, leave it out” – keep diagrams simple and focused.

Q10: Example scenario – how to apply a use case diagram:
A10:
- A medical expert system:
- Registered user → virtual doctor → diagnosis.
- If virtual doctor fails → video call with real doctor.

Payment varies by insurance coverage.
Diagram actors, primary/secondary users, and flows accordingly.
