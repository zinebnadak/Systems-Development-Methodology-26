Different types of requirements

Q1: What is the primary difference between Functional and Non-functional requirements?
A1: * Functional requirements describe the specific services the system must provide , how it reacts to particular inputs , and what outputs it should produce.
+2
* Non-functional requirements are constraints on the system. They often affect the system as a whole and include categories like performance, reliability, and legal constraints.


Q2: How are Non-functional requirements categorized?
A2: They are typically divided into three main areas:
* Product Requirements: These include usability, reliability, performance, and resource needs.
* Organizational Requirements: These cover development processes and delivery standards.
* External Requirements: These involve legal aspects, ethics, and sustainability.


Q3: What makes a Non-functional requirement "measurable"?
A3: A requirement is measurable when it is defined with exact metrics rather than vague terms like "easy to use".
+1
* Examples of metrics: Mean time between failures (Reliability), Frames per second (Performance), or training hours required for a user to master the system (Usability).


Q4: What is the "FURPS+" model?
A4: FURPS+ is a framework for categorizing requirements:
* Functionality
* Usability
* Reliability
* Performance
* Supportability
* + (Plus) represents additional constraints on design, implementation, and environment.


Q5: What is the difference between User Requirements and System Requirements?
A5: * User Requirements (High Abstraction): These are brief descriptions (often user stories) of what the system should do or who will use it. They avoid technical details.
+2
* System Requirements (Low Abstraction): These are detailed, exact descriptions of functionality. They break high-level requirements into smaller parts and often use templates including preconditions, descriptions, and postconditions
