Requirements Analysis and Management

Q1: Why is requirements analysis critical?
A1: It defines what the system must do; poor analysis → failed system.

Q2: Who typically writes initial requirements and why is this risky?
A2: Often non-technical stakeholders; can be incomplete or wrong.

Q3: How should requirements be captured?
A3: From multiple stakeholders using interviews, observation, scenarios; documented as text or diagrams.

Q4: Why consider different viewpoints?
A4: Users, indirect stakeholders, and domain constraints all affect requirements.

Q5: Why is full specification impossible for large systems?
A5: Requirements evolve as users interact with the system; new needs appear.

Q6: Why do change requests occur?
A6: System use reveals new needs, errors, or improvements; they are inevitable.
