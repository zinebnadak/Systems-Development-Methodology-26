------------------- Software Development Processes -------------------


Q1: What are the four fundamental activities common to almost all software processes?
A1: Despite their differences, most processes include these four stages:
* Software Specification: Defining what the system should do.
* Software Design and Implementation: Organizing and building the system.
* Software Validation: Checking the system to ensure it meets the customer's requirements.
* Software Evolution: Modifying the system in response to changing needs.


Q2: What is the "Waterfall Model" and what is its primary characteristic?
A2: The Waterfall model is a plan-driven process where all activities are completed in a linear sequence. Each phase—such as requirements, design, or implementation—must be finished before the next one begins. It is characterized by heavy documentation and is often considered inflexible when requirements change during development.

Q3: How does "Incremental Development" differ from the Waterfall model?
A3: Instead of delivering the entire system at once, Incremental Development breaks the project into smaller parts.
* Faster Feedback: The customer can see and test parts of the system earlier.
* Reduced Cost of Change: It is easier and cheaper to change requirements as the project progresses compared to the Waterfall model.
* Progress Tracking: One disadvantage is that it can be harder for managers to track overall progress because documentation is often less formal.


Q4: What is "Integration and Configuration" (Reuse-oriented) development?
A4: This approach focuses on building systems by integrating existing software components or COTS (Commercial Off-The-Shelf) systems rather than writing everything from scratch. While it reduces costs and allows for faster delivery, the developer has less control over the evolution of the reused components.


Q5: What is the "Spiral Model"?
A5: The Spiral model is an iterative process where the project circles through various phases, with a heavy emphasis on risk assessment. Each loop in the spiral represents a phase of the process, starting with objective setting and ending with a review and plan for the next iteration.


Q6: What are "Agile Methods" and why were they developed?
A6: Agile methods were created to handle the rapid change of requirements in modern software projects. They focus on:
* Iterative Delivery: Frequent releases of working software.
* Human Interaction: Prioritizing communication over strict processes and tools.
* Customer Involvement: Constant collaboration with the user.
* Flexibility: Embracing change rather than following a rigid plan.



------------------- Agile Methods: Fundamental Theory -------------------


Q1: What are the core values of the Agile Manifesto?
A1: The Agile Manifesto prioritizes certain values to handle rapidly changing requirements:
* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
* Working software over comprehensive documentation.
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
* Responding to change over following a plan.


Q2: What are the key principles of Agile development?
A2: Agile development is guided by several practical principles:
* Customer involvement: Customers provide priorities and evaluate iterations.
* Incremental delivery: Software is developed in small steps with frequent releases.
* People, not process: The skills of the team are recognized and utilized without over-reliance on formal procedures.
* Embrace change: Systems are designed to expect and accommodate changing requirements.
* Maintain simplicity: Focus on the work required to meet current needs rather than over-engineering.


Q3: What is "Extreme Programming" (XP) and its technical practices?
A3: XP is a highly influential agile method that introduced several specific technical practices:
* Test-driven development (TDD): Writing tests before the actual code to ensure requirements are met and simplify debugging.
* Pair programming: Two developers work together at one computer to improve code quality and share knowledge.
* Refactoring: Constantly improving the code structure to keep it simple and maintainable.
* Continuous Integration: Changes are integrated into the main system as soon as they are finished and tested.


Q4: How does the Scrum framework organize work?
A4: Scrum is an agile method focused on managing iterative development through specific roles and events:
* Sprints: Fixed-length development cycles, usually 2–4 weeks long.
* Product Backlog: A prioritized list of "to-do" items or features required for the project.
* Daily Scrum: A short daily meeting where the team coordinates work and identifies "bottlenecks".
* Roles: Includes the Product Owner (prioritizes the backlog), the Scrum Master (removes obstacles), and the Development Team.


Q5: What are the benefits of using Scrum?
A5: Scrum offers several advantages for project management:
* Visibility: The product is broken down into manageable chunks, making progress easier to see.
* Communication: Daily meetings and defined roles improve team collaboration.
* Customer Trust: Frequent delivery of working increments builds confidence with the customer.
* Reduced Risk: Unstable requirements do not stall the entire project since work is organized in short bursts.
