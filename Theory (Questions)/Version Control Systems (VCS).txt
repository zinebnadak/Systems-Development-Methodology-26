Q1: What is the primary purpose of a Version Control System?
A1: A Version Control System is a tool used to manage changes to source code and other files over time. It allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously by keeping track of every modification in a central or distributed repository. If a mistake is made, developers can compare different versions of the code and revert to an earlier state.


Q2: What are the differences between Centralized (CVCS) and Distributed (DVCS) systems?
A2: * Centralized (e.g., Subversion): Uses a single central server that stores all versions of the files. Developers check out files from this central location, but if the server goes down, collaboration and version history access are lost.
* Distributed (e.g., Git): Every developer has a full copy (mirror) of the entire repository, including its full history, on their local machine. This allows for offline work and provides better security, as every local copy acts as a backup.


Q3: What are the fundamental "Areas" or states of a file in Git?
A3: Git projects consist of three main sections:
* Working Directory: Where you currently modify files.
* Staging Area (Index): A place where you "stage" or mark changes that you want to include in your next commit.
* Repository (.git directory): Where Git stores the metadata and the compressed database of all committed versions.


Q4: What are "Commits" and "Branches"?
A4: * Commit: A snapshot of your files at a specific point in time. Each commit has a unique ID (SHA-1 hash) and contains a message describing the changes.
* Branch: A separate line of development that allows you to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the "main" (stable) code. You can later "Merge" these changes back into the main branch.


Q5: How do developers collaborate using remote repositories?
A5: Developers use several key commands to sync their work with a remote server (like GitHub or GitLab):
* Clone: Creates a local copy of a remote repository.
* Pull: Fetches changes from the remote server and merges them into the local code.
* Push: Sends local commits to the remote repository so others can see them.
* Fetch: Downloads changes from the remote server but does not automatically merge them into your working files.


Q6: What is a "Merge Conflict"?
A6: A merge conflict occurs when two different developers change the same part of the same file and try to merge their work. The system cannot decide which version is correct, so the developer must manually resolve the conflict by choosing which code to keep.
